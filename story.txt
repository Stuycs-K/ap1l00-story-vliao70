Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no **bitcoin**
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on **crypto**, I thought I would run about
a little and see the dark part of the **stock market**. It is a way I have of driving off the
**scammers** and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the **economy**;
whenever it is a **expensive**, **sad** November in my basement; whenever I find myself involuntarily
**looting** before coffin Atlanta, and bringing up the rear of every **stranger** I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a **painful**
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately hiding into the **freezer**, and methodically
wiping people's **hard drive** off—then, I account it high time to get to **devious activities** as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all assets in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the chat with me.

There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs--commerce surrounds it with her surf.
